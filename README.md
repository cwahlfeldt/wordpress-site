Hey this is my wordpress WIP. It is local at the moment but I will push to a live site later when I figure out what the hell im doing. This site will be a portfolio site for lots of work that I do, but mainly my 3D art. It will also contain my resume and contact, as well as an about page and a blog. If you know more than I do about wordpress development, which is an automatic YES because I barely know shit, feel free to check out my files and help me...:)
